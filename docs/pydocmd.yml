# This tells pydocmd which pages to generate from which Python modules,
# functions and classes. At the first level is the page name, below that
# is a tree of Python member names (modules, classes, etc.) that should be
# documented. Higher indentation leads to smaller header size.

# MkDocs pages configuration. The `<<` operator is sugar added by pydocmd
# that allows you to use an external Markdown file (eg. your project's README)
# in the documentation. The path must be relative to current working directory.
# This configuration is not mandatory if you have your own mkdocs.yml config file.

# Note: if using the simple generator mode, this will default to 'markdown'
